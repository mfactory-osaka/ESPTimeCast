## ü™õ Wiring



**Power Supply Change** Switching from 3.3V to 5V for Display

 Note: Pins are in the same position but make sure the right declaration in in your sketch

**Board ‚Üí MAX7219**  

| D1 Mini (Micro USB) | D1 Mini (USB C) | D1 Mini (ESP 32) | S2 Mini | MAX 7219 |
|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:------|
|  GND  |  GND  |  GND  |  GND  |  GND  |
|  5V   |  5V/VBUS   |  5V/VBUS   |  5V/VBUS   |  VCC  | 
|  D5   |  14   |  18   |  7    |  CLK  | 
|  D7   |  13   |  23   |  11   |  CS   |
|  D8   |  15   |  5    |  12   |  DIN  |


<img src="assets/wiring3.png" alt="Wiring" width="800" />

Tip: Always double-check that VCC (5 V), GND, and DIN/CS/CLK match your MAX7219 module‚Äôs pin order ‚Äî different modules sometimes label them differently.

**Important hardware update:**  
Pins have been update to be solder in the same place for all the Wemos boards, Check your board version and update the sketch accordingly.
After observing overheating issues and unstable behavior when powering the MAX7219 matrix from the Mini D1‚Äôs 3.3V pin, we‚Äôre officially switching to powering the display via the 5V USB rail instead.  

**What‚Äôs changing:**
- Before: Display VCC was connected to 3.3V pin on the ESP board.
- Now: Display VCC will be connected to the board‚Äôs 5V pin (which comes directly from USB power).
  
**Why this change is needed:**
- The MAX7219 LED matrix is designed for 5V operation.  
- The onboard 3.3V regulator (usually an AMS1117) on the Mini D1 is very limited in current output (~800mA max, often much less in practice).  
- High-brightness matrix modules ‚Äî especially green/yellow displays ‚Äî can draw enough current to overload the regulator, causing:
  - Overheating
  - Voltage drop
  - Complete regulator failure (some users reported only 2.4V output after damage)

**Benefits of using 5V:**
- Higher brightness and more stable matrix performance
- Reduced heat load on the ESP8266 board
- Avoid long-term damage to the onboard regulator
- The MAX7219 works fine with 3.3V logic signals from the ESP (no need for level shifters)

### ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Uploading the Code and Data

Once your Arduino IDE is set up for your board (as described above):

1.  **Open the Project Folder:**
    * For ESP8266: Navigate to and open the `ESPTimceCast_ESP8266` project folder. Inside, you'll find the main sketch file, typically named `ESPTimceCast_ESP8266.ino`. Open this `.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
    * For ESP32: Navigate to and open the `ESPTimceCast_ESP32` project folder. Inside, you'll find the main sketch file, typically named `ESPTimceCast_ESP32.ino`. Open this `.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
2. **Upload the Sketch:**
    * With the main sketch file open, click the "Upload" button (the right arrow icon) in the Arduino IDE toolbar. This will compile the entire project and upload it to your board.
3.  **Upload `/data` folder (LittleFS):**
    * This project uses LittleFS for storing web interface files and other assets. You'll need the LittleFS Uploader plugin.
    * [**Install the LittleFS Uploader Plugin**](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/arduino-ide-2-install-esp8266-littlefs/) 
    * **Before uploading, ensure the Serial Monitor is closed.**
    * Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows, `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS).
    * Search for and run: `Upload Little FS to Pico/ESP8266/ESP32` (the exact command name might vary).
    * **Important for ESP32:** If the upload fails, you might need to manually put your ESP32 into "Download Mode." While holding down the **Boot button** (often labeled 'BOOT' or 'IO0' or 'IO9'), briefly press and release the **RST button**, then release the Boot button.

## üì∫ Display Behavior

**ESPTimeCast** automatically switches between two display modes: Clock and Weather.
If "Show Weather Description" is enabled a third mode (Description) will display with a duration of 3 seconds, if the description is too long to fit on the display the description will scroll from right to left once.

What you see on the LED matrix depends on whether the device has successfully fetched the current time (via NTP) and weather (via OpenWeatherMap).  
The following table summarizes what will appear on the display in each scenario:

| Display Mode | üïí NTP Time | üå¶Ô∏è Weather Data | üì∫ Display Output                              |
|:------------:|:----------:|:--------------:|:--------------------------------------------|
| **Clock**    | ‚úÖ Yes      | ‚Äî              | üóìÔ∏è Day Icon + ‚è∞ Time (e.g. `@ 14:53`)           |
| **Clock**    | ‚ùå No       | ‚Äî              |  `! NTP` (NTP sync failed)               |
| **Weather**  | ‚Äî          | ‚úÖ Yes         | üå°Ô∏è Temperature (e.g. `23¬∫C`)                |
| **Weather**  | ‚úÖ Yes      | ‚ùå No          | üóìÔ∏è Day Icon + ‚è∞ Time (e.g. `@ 14:53`)           |
| **Weather**  | ‚ùå No       | ‚ùå No          |  `! TEMP` (no weather or time data)       |

### **How it works:**

- The display automatically alternates between **Clock** and **Weather** modes (the duration for each is configurable).
- If "Show Weather Description" is enabled a third mode **Description** will display after the **Weather** display with a duration of 3 seconds.
- In **Clock** mode, if NTP time is available, you‚Äôll see the current time plus a unique day-of-week icon. If NTP is not available, you'll see `! NTP`.
- In **Weather** mode, if weather is available, you‚Äôll see the temperature (like `23¬∫C`). If weather is not available but time is, it falls back to showing the clock. If neither is available, you‚Äôll see `! TEMP`.
- All status/error messages (`! NTP`, `! TEMP`) are big icons shown on the display.

**Legend:**
- üóìÔ∏è **Day Icon**: Custom symbol for day of week (`@`, `=`, etc.)
- ‚è∞ **Time**: Current time (HH:MM)
- üå°Ô∏è **Temperature**: Weather from OpenWeatherMap
- ‚úÖ **Yes**: Data available
- ‚ùå **No**: Data not available
- ‚Äî : Value does not affect this mode
